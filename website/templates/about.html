<h1 class="text-secondary" align="">About Me</h1>
<p class="">Hey, I'm Danie. Most folks know me as "iniTwakkie" online.</p>

<p class="">
  I'm currently the Developer Experience at Vercel, where I lead our Developer
  Relations and Documentation teams. I focus on educating and growing the Vercel
  and Next.js communities. I'm passionate about many creative pursuits,
  including music, photography, videography, and of course, coding.
</p>

<p class="">
  This combination of interests is what ultimately led me to my current role in
  building developer communities. I love building for the web. From something as
  simple as a single HTML file, all the way to large Next.js applications. The
  web is incredible.
</p>

<p class="">
  Anyone can become a developer, writer, or creator, and no one has to ask for
  permission. You can just build. Outside of Vercel, I angel invest in developer
  tools companies and advise early-stage startups. I also do Developer Relations
  consulting work, helping companies take their DevRel function from 0 to 1, or
  provide guidance on growing communities, content creation, and developer
  marketing.
</p>
