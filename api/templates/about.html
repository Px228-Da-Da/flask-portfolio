<h1 class="text-secondary" align="">About Me</h1>
<p class="">
  Are you excited to hear a
  <strong class="text-info">story about transformation?</strong>
</p>

<p class="">
  Well, let me introduce myself - most people know me as
  <strong class="text-info">"Danny"</strong>, a Python Developer. But my path to
  this career was far from straightforward. For over a decade, I worked as an
  Accountant. However, as time passed, I found myself irresistibly drawn to the
  dynamic and creative world of software development.
</p>

<p class="">
  I discovered a passion for problem-solving, logical thinking, and the
  flexibility and versatility of Python as a programming language. Through
  Python, I found the opportunity to work on projects that have a direct impact
  on people's lives, and I knew that this was my
  <strong class="text-info"> true calling.</strong>
</p>

<p class="">
  So, despite being in my early 30s, I made the bold decision to take a leap of
  faith and transition into a new career as a Python Developer. And I have to
  say, it was one of the best decisions I've ever made.
</p>

<p class="">
  Now, I'm on a mission to create solutions that make a difference, using my
  skills and expertise in Finance and Python.
