<h1 class="text-secondary" align="">About Me</h1>
<p class="">
  Are you ready for a
  <strong style="color: lightslategray">story of transformation?</strong>
</p>

<p class="">
  Hi there, most folks
  <strong style="color: lightslategray">know me as "Danny"</strong>, and I'm a
  &#128013;Python Developer. But my journey to get here wasn't a straightforward
  one. For the last 10 odd years, I have been working as an Accountant. But as
  time went on, I found myself drawn to the dynamic and creative world of
  software development.
</p>

<p class="">
  I discovered my passion for problem-solving, logical thinking, flexibility and
  versatility of Python as a programming language. With Python, I found the
  opportunity to work on projects that have a direct impact on people's lives,
  and I knew I had
  <strong style="color: lightslategray">found my calling.</strong>
</p>

<p class="">
  So I made the bold decision to take a leap of faith and transition into a new
  career as a Python Developer in my early 30s. And let me tell you, it was one
  of the best decisions I've ever made.
</p>

<p class="">
  Now, I'm on a mission to create solutions that make a difference, using my
  skills and expertise in Python. Join me on this journey of transformation, and
  have a look what I up too in my
  <a href="/blog" class="">Blog </a>and
  <a href="/projects" class="">Projects</a>...
</p>
